"In the diagram below, we have $AB = 24$ and $\angle ADB =90^\circ$.  If $\sin A = \frac23$ and $\sin C = \frac34$, then what is $BC$?

[/asy]",0.0,Precalculus,"From right triangle $ABD$, we have $\sin A = \frac{BD}{AB} = \frac{BD}{24}$.  Since $\sin A = \frac23$, we have $\frac23 = \frac{BD}{24}$, so $BD = \frac23\cdot 24 = 16$.

From right triangle $BCD$, we have $\sin C = \frac{BD}{BC}=\frac{16}{BC}$.  Since $\sin C = \frac34$, we have $\frac{16}{BC} = \frac34$.  Therefore, we have $3BC = 4\cdot 16$, and $BC = \boxed{\frac{64}{3}}$."
"The sum of the first $n$ terms in the infinite geometric sequence $\left\{\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{16},\dots \right\}$ is $\frac{255}{512}$. Find $n$.",3.0,Algebra,"This is a geometric sequence with first term $\frac{1}{4}$ and common ratio $\frac{1}{2}$. Thus the sum of the first $n$ terms is:

$\frac{255}{512}=\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{1-\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^n}{1-\frac{1}{2}}\right)=\frac{2^n-1}{2^{n+1}}$.

We see that $\frac{255}{512}=\frac{2^8-1}{2^9}$, so $n=\boxed{8}$."
P.J. has a cylindrical mug with a 3-inch diameter. His mug is filled to a height of 6 inches with grape juice. Schuyler has a cylindrical mug with a 4-inch diameter. To what height in inches must Schuyler's mug be filled so that he receives the same amount of juice as P.J.? Express your answer as a mixed number.,2.0,Geometry,"P.J.'s juice fills up a cylinder with radius 3/2 inches and height 6 inches; his juice has volume $\pi \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2(6)= \frac{27\pi}{2}$ cubic inches.

Schuyler's juice fills up a cylinder with radius 2 inches and unknown height $h$ inches; his juice has volume $\pi (2^2) (h) = 4\pi h$ cubic inches.  Setting this equal to P.J.'s volume and solving for $h$ yields $\frac{27\pi}{2} = 4\pi h \Rightarrow h = \frac{27}{8}= \boxed{3 \frac{3}{8}}$ inches."
What is $(1 + 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \div 11$?,0.0,Prealgebra,"First, we evaluate the expression in the parentheses. Since multiplication has precedence over addition, $1 + 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 1 + 120 = 121$. Our original expression evaluates to $(1 + 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5) \div 11 = 121 \div 11 = \boxed{11}.$"
"What is the distance, in units, between the points $(2, -6)$ and $(-4, 3)$? Express your answer in simplest radical form.",2.0,Algebra,"We use the distance formula:  \begin{align*}
\sqrt{(2 - (-4))^2 + ((-6) - 3)^2} &= \sqrt{6^2 + (-9)^2}\\
& = \sqrt{36 + 81}\\
& = \sqrt{117} = \boxed{3\sqrt{13}}.
\end{align*}"
